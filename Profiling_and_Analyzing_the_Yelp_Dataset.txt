Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
select count(*)
from attribute


ii. Business table = 10000
select count(*)
from business

iii. Category table = 10000
select count(*)
from category

iv. Checkin table = 10000
select count(*)
from checkin

v. elite_years table = 10000
select  count(*)
from elite_years

vi. friend table = 10000
select count(*)
from friend

vii. hours table = 10000 
select count(*)
from hours

viii. photo table = 10000
select count(*)
from photo

ix. review table = 10000
select count(*)
from review

x. tip table = 10000
select count(*)
from tip


xi. user table = 10000
select count(*)
from user

	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
select count(distinct id)
from business

ii. Hours = 10000
select count(distinct (business_id) )
from hours

iii. Category = 2643
select count(distinct (business_id))
from category

iv. Attribute = 1115
select count(distinct (business_id))
from attribute


v. Review = 10000
id:10000, 
business_id: 8090, 
user_id: 9581


vi. Checkin = 493
select distinct (business_id)
from checkin

vii. Photo = 10000
select count(distinct (id))
from photo

viii. Tip = 537
--use foreign key user_id
select count(distinct (user_id))
from tip

ix. User = 10000
select distinct (id)
from user

x. Friend = 11
select count(distinct (user_id))
from friend

xi. Elite_years = 2780
select distinct(user_id)
from elite_years


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
select *

or yelping_since is null 
or useful is null

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Posing more reviews does correlate with more fans, as shown in the table below. However, it's not entirely based on reviews count,
it also relate to the user's platform join date. The longer they join Yelp, more fans they have. 
	
	
Code:
select fans, review_count, name, yelping_since
from user
order by fans desc

Result:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Shopping business in Las Vegas has different distrubution of hours. The 3-5 stars group closes before 20:00, the 2-3 stars group closes at 22:00.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
The 4-5 stars group and 2-3 start group have different number of reviews. 
Only 2 of 4-5 stars group business has more than 10 reviews, all other business have less then 10 reviews.          
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No. Not enough information to make a conclusion. 

SQL code used for analysis:

select b.name, h.hours, b.stars,
case 
	when h.hours like "%Monday%" then 1
	when h.hours like "%Tuesday%" then 2
	when h.hours like "%Wednesday%" then 3
	when h.hours like "%Thursday%" then 4
	when h.hours like "%Friday%" then 5
	when h.hours like "%Saturday%" then 6
	when h.hours like "%Sunday%" then 7
end as op_day,
case
    when b.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'
    when b.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5 stars'
end as stars_category
from 
business b join hours h on b.id = h.business_id
join category c on b.id = c.business_id
where b.city = "Las Vegas" and c.category = "Shopping" 
    and (b.stars between 2 and 3) or (b.stars between 4 and 5)
group by stars,op_day
order by op_day, stars_category
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The businesses  that are stil open have higher reviews count than the one that are closed.
         
ii. Difference 2:
The businesses that are still open have higher average review count than the closed one.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

select 
count(distinct(id)),
sum(review_count),avg(stars), avg(review_count),
is_open
from business
group by is_open 

Result:
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+
| count(distinct(id)) | sum(review_count) |    avg(stars) | avg(review_count) | is_open |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+
|                1520 |             35261 | 3.52039473684 |     23.1980263158 |       0 |
|                8480 |            269300 | 3.67900943396 |     31.7570754717 |       1 |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: 
Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. 
These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. 
Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Waht's the hottest business category in different cities of Arizon by amount of reviews received?
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
We need to group the cities and categories for business in Arizona (AZ), and rank the reviews received in each category. 
This will give innestors an overviewo of what type of business category is the hottest right now, and in whihch city.             
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
